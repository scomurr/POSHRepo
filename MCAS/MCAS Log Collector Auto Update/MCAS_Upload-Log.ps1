# Summary: This script will download and then upload the provided zip file to an
# MCAS collector machine waiting which will then upload to MCAS and populate the
# discovery dashboards.

# Flow:
# 1. Start the VM
# 2. wait for the VM to fire all the way up
# 3. Upload the zip
# 4. Wait for > 5 minutes so that the log is uploaded to MCAS
# 5. Shutdown the vm

# Script leverages the CredentialManager Module
# https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/CredentialManager/2.0
