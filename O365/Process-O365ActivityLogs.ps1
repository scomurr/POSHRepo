# Summary: Handles the output from the Get script. Simply demos how the records are
# returned and then displays a grouped list of all of the userids

.\Get-O365ActivityLogs.ps1 | out-file C:\windows\temp\out.txt

# This will give you a collection of objects and each object will contain multiple records
# This will throw some errors but that is due to the header records that are not in json
# format. Ignore.
$output = gc c:\windows\temp\out.txt | %{$_ | convertfrom-json} | ?{$null -ne $_}

# This exands each of the json chunks so that we now have a collection of records
$output = $output | %{$_}

#$output | ?{$_.UserID -match "sync"} | select -property UserID | sort -Unique

$output | select -property userid | sort userid -Unique
